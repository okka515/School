once
upon
a
time,
a
certain
ronin,
tajima
shume
by
name,
an
able
and
well-read
man,
being
on
his
travels
to
see
the
world,
went
up
to
kiyoto
by
the
tokaido.
[the
road
of
the
eastern
sea,
the
famous
highroad
leading
from
kiyoto
to
yedo.
the
name
is
also
used
to
indicate
the
provinces
through
which
it
runs.]
one
day,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
nagoya,
in
the
province
of
owari,
he
fell
in
with
a
wandering
priest,
with
whom
he
entered
into
conversation.
finding
that
they
were
bound
for
the
same
place,
they
agreed
to
travel
together,
beguiling
their
weary
way
by
pleasant
talk
on
divers
matters;
and
so
by
degrees,
as
they
became
more
intimate,
they
began
to
speak
without
restraint
about
their
private
affairs;
and
the
priest,
trusting
thoroughly
in
the
honour
of
his
companion,
told
him
the
object
of
his
journey.
"for
some
time
past,"
said
he,
"i
have
nourished
a
wish
that
has
engrossed
all
my
thoughts;
for
i
am
bent
on
setting
up
a
molten
image
in
honour
of
buddha;
with
this
object
i
have
wandered
through
various
provinces
collecting
alms,
and
(who
knows
by
what
weary
toil?)
we
have
succeeded
in
amassing
two
hundred
ounces
of
silver
enough,
i
trust,
to
erect
a
handsome
bronze
figure."
what
says
the
proverb?
"he
who
bears
a
jewel
in
his
bosom
bears
poison."
hardly
had
the
ronin
heard
these
words
of
the
priest
than
an
evil
heart
arose
within
him,
and
he
thought
to
himself,
"man's
life,
from
the
womb
to
the
grave,
is
made
up
of
good
and
of
ill
luck.
here
am
i,
nearly
forty
years
old,
a
wanderer,
without
a
calling,
or
even
a
hope
of
advancement
in
the
world.
to
be
sure,
it
seems
a
shame;
yet
if
i
could
steal
the
money
this
priest
is
boasting
about,
i
could
live
at
ease
for
the
rest
of
my
days;"
and
so
he
began
casting
about
how
best
he
might
compass
his
purpose.
but
the
priest,
far
from
guessing
the
drift
of
his
comrade's
thoughts,
journeyed
cheerfully
on
till
they
reached
the
town
of
kuana.
here
there
is
an
arm
of
the
sea,
which
is
crossed
in
ferry-boats,
that
start
as
soon
as
some
twenty
or
thirty
passengers
are
gathered
together;
and
in
one
of
these
boats
the
two
travellers
embarked.
about
half-way
across,
the
priest
was
taken
with
a
sudden
necessity
to
go
to
the
side
of
the
boat;
and
the
ronin,
following
him,
tripped
him
up
while
no
one
was
looking,
and
flung
him
into
the
sea.
when
the
boatmen
and
passengers
heard
the
splash,
and
saw
the
priest
struggling
in
the
water,
they
were
afraid,
and
made
every
effort
to
save
him;
but
the
wind
was
fair,
and
the
boat
running
swiftly
under
the
bellying
sails;
so
they
were
soon
a
few
hundred
yards
off
from
the
drowning
man,
who
sank
before
the
boat
could
be
turned
to
rescue
him.
when
he
saw
this,
the
ronin
feigned
the
utmost
grief
and
dismay,
and
said
to
his
fellow-passengers,
"this
priest,
whom
we
have
just
lost,
was
my
cousin;
he
was
going
to
kiyoto,
to
visit
the
shrine
of
his
patron;
and
as
i
happened
to
have
business
there
as
well,
we
settled
to
travel
together.
now,
alas!
by
this
misfortune,
my
cousin
is
dead,
and
i
am
left
alone."
he
spoke
so
feelingly,
and
wept
so
freely,
that
the
passengers
believed
his
story,
and
pitied
and
tried
to
comfort
him.
then
the
ronin
said
to
the
boatmen:
"we
ought,
by
rights,
to
report
this
matter
to
the
authorities;
but
as
i
am
pressed
for
time,
and
the
business
might
bring
trouble
on
yourselves
as
well,
perhaps
we
had
better
hush
it
up
for
the
present;
i
will
at
once
go
on
to
kiyoto
and
tell
my
cousin's
patron,
besides
writing
home
about
it.
what
think
you,
gentlemen?"
added
he,
turning
to
the
other
travellers.
they,
of
course,
were
only
too
glad
to
avoid
any
hindrance
to
their
onward
journey,
and
all
with
one
voice
agreed
to
what
the
ronin
had
proposed;
and
so
the
matter
was
settled.
when,
at
length,
they
reached
the
shore,
they
left
the
boat,
and
every
man
went
his
way;
but
the
ronin,
overjoyed
in
his
heart,
took
the
wandering
priest's
luggage,
and,
putting
it
with
his
own,
pursued
his
journey
to
kiyoto.
on
reaching
the
capital,
the
ronin
changed
his
name
from
shume
to
tokubei,
and,
giving
up
his
position
as
a
samurai,
turned
merchant,
and
traded
with
the
dead
man's
money.
fortune
favouring
his
speculations,
he
began
to
amass
great
wealth,
and
lived
at
his
ease,
denying
himself
nothing;
and
in
course
of
time
he
married
a
wife,
who
bore
him
a
child.
thus
the
days
and
months
wore
on,
till
one
fine
summer's
night,
some
three
years
after
the
priest's
death,
tokubei
stepped
out
on
the
veranda
of
his
house
to
enjoy
the
cool
air
and
the
beauty
of
the
moonlight.
feeling
dull
and
lonely,
he
began
musing
over
all
kinds
of
things,
when
on
a
sudden
the
deed
of
murder
and
theft,
done
so
long
ago,
vividly
recurred
to
his
memory,
and
he
thought
to
himself,
"here
am
i,
grown
rich
and
fat
on
the
money
i
wantonly
stole.
since
then,
all
has
gone
well
with
me;
yet,
had
i
not
been
poor,
i
had
never
turned
assassin
nor
thief.
woe
betide
me!
what
a
pity
it
was!"
and
as
he
was
revolving
the
matter
in
his
mind,
a
feeling
of
remorse
came
over
him,
in
spite
of
all
he
could
do.
while
his
conscience
thus
smote
him,
he
suddenly,
to
his
utter
amazement,
beheld
the
faint
outline
of
a
man
standing
near
a
fir-tree
in
the
garden;
on
looking
more
attentively,
he
perceived
that
the
man's
whole
body
was
thin
and
worn,
and
the
eyes
sunken
and
dim;
and
in
that
poor
ghost
that
was
before
him
he
recognised
the
very
priest
whom
he
had
thrown
into
the
sea
at
kuana.
chilled
with
horror,
he
looked
again,
and
saw
that
the
priest
was
smiling
in
scorn.
he
would
have
fled
into
the
house,
but
the
ghost
stretched
forth
its
withered
arm,
and,
clutching
the
back
of
his
neck,
scowled
at
him
with
a
vindictive
glare
and
a
hideous
ghastliness
of
mien
so
unspeakably
awful
that
any
ordinary
man
would
have
swooned
with
fear.
but
tokubei,
tradesman
though
he
was,
had
once
been
a
soldier,
and
was
not
easily
matched
for
daring;
so
he
shook
off
the
ghost,
and,
leaping
into
the
room
for
his
dirk,
laid
about
him
boldly
enough;
but,
strike
as
he
would,
the
spirit,
fading
into
the
air,
eluded
his
blows,
and
suddenly
reappeared
only
to
vanish
again;
and
from
that
time
forth
tokubei
knew
no
rest,
and
was
haunted
night
and
day.
at
length,
undone
by
such
ceaseless
vexation,
tokubei
fell
ill,
and
kept
muttering,
"oh,
misery!
misery!
the
wandering
priest
is
coming
to
torture
me!"
hearing
his
moans
and
the
disturbance
he
made,
the
people
in
the
house
fancied
he
was
mad,
and
called
in
a
physician,
who
prescribed
for
him.
but
neither
pill
nor
potion
could
cure
tokubei,
whose
strange
frenzy
soon
became
the
talk
of
the
whole
neighbourhood.
now
it
chanced
that
the
story
reached
the
ears
of
a
certain
wandering
priest
who
lodged
in
the
next
street.
when
he
heard
the
particulars,
this
priest
gravely
shook
his
head
as
though
he
knew
all
about
it,
and
sent
a
friend
to
tokubei's
house
to
say
that
a
wandering
priest,
dwelling
hard
by,
had
heard
of
his
illness,
and,
were
it
never
so
grievous,
would
undertake
to
heal
it
by
means
of
his
prayers;
and
tokubei's
wife,
driven
half
wild
by
her
husband's
sickness,
lost
not
a
moment
in
sending
for
the
priest
and
taking
him
into
the
sick
man's
room.
but
no
sooner
did
tokubei
see
the
priest
than
he
yelled
out,
"help!
help!
here
is
the
wandering
priest
come
to
torment
me
again.
forgive!
forgive!"
and
hiding
his
head
under
the
coverlet,
he
lay
quivering
all
over.
then
the
priest
turned
all
present
out
of
the
room,
put
his
mouth
to
the
affrighted
man's
ear,
and
whispered:
"three
years
ago,
at
the
kuana
ferry,
you
flung
me
into
the
water;
and
well
you
remember
it."
but
tokubei
was
speechless,
and
could
only
quake
with
fear.
"happily,"
continued
the
priest,
"i
had
learned
to
swim
and
to
dive
as
a
boy;
so
i
reached
the
shore,
and,
after
wandering
through
many
provinces,
succeeded
in
setting
up
a
bronze
figure
to
buddha,
thus
fulfilling
the
wish
of
my
heart.
on
my
journey
homeward,
i
took
a
lodging
in
the
next
street,
and
there
heard
of
your
marvellous
ailment.
thinking
i
could
divine
its
cause,
i
came
to
see
you,
and
am
glad
to
find
i
was
not
mistaken.
you
have
done
a
hateful
deed;
but
am
i
not
a
priest,
and
have
i
not
forsaken
the
things
of
this
world,
and
would
it
not
ill
become
me
to
bear
malice?
repent,
therefore,
and
abandon
your
evil
ways.
to
see
you
do
so
i
should
esteem
the
height
of
happiness.
be
of
good
cheer,
now,
and
look
me
in
the
face,
and
you
will
see
that
i
am
really
a
living
man,
and
no
vengeful
goblin
come
to
torment
you."
seeing
he
had
no
ghost
to
deal
with,
and
overwhelmed
by
the
priest's
kindness,
tokubei
burst
into
tears,
and
answered,
"indeed,
indeed,
i
don't
know
what
to
say.
in
a
fit
of
madness
i
was
tempted
to
kill
and
rob
you.
fortune
befriended
me
ever
after;
but
the
richer
i
grew,
the
more
keenly
i
felt
how
wicked
i
had
been,
and
the
more
i
foresaw
that
my
victim's
vengeance
would
some
day
overtake
me.
haunted
by
this
thought,
i
lost
my
nerve,
till
one
night
i
beheld
your
spirit,
and
from
that
time
fell
ill.
but
how
you
managed
to
escape,
and
are
still
alive,
is
more
than
i
can
understand."
"a
guilty
man,"
said
the
priest,
with
a
smile,
"shudders
at
the
rustling
of
the
wind
or
the
chattering
of
a
stork's
beak;
a
murderer's
conscience
preys
upon
his
mind
till
he
sees
what
is
not.
poverty
drives
a
man
to
crimes
which
he
repents
of
in
his
wealth.
how
true
is
the
doctrine
of
moshi
[mencius],
that
the
heart
of
man,
pure
by
nature,
is
corrupted
by
circumstances!"
thus
he
held
forth;
and
tokubei,
who
had
long
since
repented
of
his
crime,
implored
forgiveness,
and
gave
him
a
large
sum
of
money,
saying,
"half
of
this
is
the
amount
i
stole
from
you
three
years
since;
the
other
half
i
entreat
you
to
accept
as
interest,
or
as
a
gift."
the
priest
at
first
refused
the
money;
but
tokubei
insisted
on
his
accepting
it,
and
did
all
he
could
to
detain
him,
but
in
vain;
for
the
priest
went
on
his
way,
and
bestowed
the
money
on
the
poor
and
needy.
as
for
tokubei
himself,
he
soon
shook
off
his
disorder,
and
thenceforward
lived
at
peace
with
all
men,
revered
both
at
home
and
abroad,
and
ever
intent
on
good
and
charitable
deeds.
